## 📖 Overview

The **Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor** is a machine learning-powered Streamlit app designed to assist medical professionals and researchers in diagnosing breast cancer. Using a set of key measurements, the app predicts whether a breast mass is **benign** or **malignant**.

This tool visually presents input data using a **radar chart** and provides:
- A predicted diagnosis
- The probability of being benign or malignant

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This app is for **educational purposes only** and **not intended for clinical use**. It was built using the publicly available [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).
